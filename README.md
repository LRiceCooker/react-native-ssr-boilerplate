# React Native SSR Boilerplate

üëã Welcome to my React Native boilerplate project! This starter kit is a labor of love, inspired by the amazing technologies that have fueled my passion for cross-platform app development. It might not be perfect, but it's crafted with enthusiasm and humility. This project is based on [next-expo-solito from Tamagui project](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/starters/next-expo-solito).

## What's Inside?

This project is a synthesis of several fantastic technologies:

- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/): A framework for building desktop apps with web technologies.
- [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/): A tool for creating delightful cross-platform apps.
- [Solito](https://solito.dev/): A monorepo management system that simplifies your project structure.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/): A tool for developing UI components in isolation.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this project, make sure you've taken a look at the following resources:

- [Getting Started with Tauri](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/next-js/)
- [Storybook for Next.js](https://storybook.js.org/recipes/next)
- [Storybook for React Native Web](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-react-native-web)
- [Creating a Tamagui App](https://tamagui.dev/docs/guides/create-tamagui-app)
- [Solito Starter](https://solito.dev/starter)

## Installation and Usage

This project operates as a monorepo and consists of three main packages:

1. **@my/ui**: Handles theming, variants, and more.
2. **@my/app**: Manages the various components of the application.
3. **@my/design**: Takes care of components and their documentation using Storybook.

To get started, use the following commands:

- `upgrade:tamagui`: Upgrade Tamagui.
- `upgrade:tamagui:canary`: Upgrade to the Tamagui Canary version.
- `update:browserlist`: Update your browser list.
- `build:types`: Build TypeScript definitions.
- `build:desktop`: Build the desktop application.
- `run:web`: Start the web application.
- `run:web:prod`: Run the production web version.
- `run:mobile`: Run the mobile application.
- `run:desktop`: Run the desktop application.
- `run:storybook`: Launch Storybook for component development.
